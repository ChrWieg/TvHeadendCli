Interface for TvHeadend

TvHeadend is a very well working solution for recording tv. It has a quite good web interface.
But I prefere TV-Browser for searching the tv program. I was looking for a way to schedule TvHeadend recordings with TV-Browser.

I've found a number of posts of users who where looking for the same, but no solution.

Then I realised that there is a rest api for TvHeadend! Thanks to dave-p: https://github.com/dave-p/TVH-API-docs/wiki

So here is a beta version for this, still under construction. It works with the TV-Browser CapturePlugin (Aufnahmesteuerung).

I'm going to provide a short tutorial soon.
